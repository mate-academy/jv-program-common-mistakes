# Web intro

* Remove autogenerated comments from `index.jsp`.
* Always add one empty line to the end of the file.
* Don't use alfa version of dependencies
* Check your jsp naming to match the [convention](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/javase/code-convention.html). It should start with lowercase letter and each adjacent word should start with capital letter. 
```
Example: thisIsMyFile.jsp
```
* If you want to run your code in the main method you should remove following line from pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
    <artifactId>servlet-api</artifactId>
    <version>2.5</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>   <!-- remove this line-->
</dependency>
```
