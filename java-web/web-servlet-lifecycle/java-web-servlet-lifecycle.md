# Servlet lifecycle

* Remove autogenerated comments from `index.jsp`.
* Always add one empty line to the end of the file.
* Don't use `super()` in `init()` and `destroy()` methods. We don't use its [purpose](https://coderanch.com/t/442337/java/super-init) right now.
* Don't use plain Java code in HTML.
