### Common Mistake

#### Simplify If-Else Constructions
Avoid using `else` blocks when they can be omitted, as this makes the code easier to read.
```java
// Bad Example:
public int returnModulus(int input) {
    if (input % 2 == 0) {
        return 0;
    } else {
        return 1;
    }
}

// Refactored code:
public int returnModulus(int input) {
    if (input % 2 == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    return 1;
}
```

#### Maintain Simplicity and Clarity in Your Code
- Avoid using short variable names that consist of only one or two letters. Other developers, including your future self, may struggle to understand the code.
- Don't unnecessarily elongate your code by adding empty lines between lines of code.
- Similarly, avoid creating redundant variables unless they solve a specific problem for you.
