### Common Mistakes

#### Adhere to the Encapsulation Principle
Remember to use access modifiers with all class elements. It's crucial to explicitly control the access level to different parts of our code.

#### Ensure Deep Copy Creation
When copying an object of class `Car` with a field `Engine` inside, bear in mind that `engine` may have non-primitive fields of its own. How will they be copied? What impact does this have on our `car` copy? Is the copy deep or shallow?

#### Maintain a Clear and Logical Structure in Your Class Methods
Your class should exhibit a clear, readable structure and a logical order of elements. Generally, order class methods by functionality. This means if you have several methods involved in completing a common task, they should be located near each other regardless of their accessibility.  
Consider the following scenario: we need to calculate the salary of an employee. In our class, we use three methods to achieve the desired result: `getMonthlySalary()`, `getInitialSalary()`, and `getMonthlyBonus()` methods.  
How should we order our methods?
```java
// Bad example: 

private int getMonthlyBonus(Person employee) {...}

// Constructor and some methods..

public int getMonthlySalary(Person employee) {
    int initialSalary = getInitialSalary(employee);
    int bonuses = getMonthlyBonus(employee);
    return initialSalary + bonuses;
}

// Other methods

private int getInitialSalary(Person employee) {...}
```
```java
// Refactored code: 

// Constructor and other class elements..

public int getMonthlySalary(Person employee) {
    int initialSalary = getInitialSalary(employee);
    int bonuses = getMonthlyBonus(employee);
    return initialSalary + bonuses;
}

private int getInitialSalary(Person employee) {...}

private int getMonthlyBonus(Person employee) {...}

// Other methods
```
In the second example, we've grouped all methods with a common purpose in one place, which makes our code easier to read and understand. If you don't have several methods with common logic, it would make sense to order them by accessibility (from `public` to `private`).
