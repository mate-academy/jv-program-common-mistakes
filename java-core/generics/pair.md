### Common mistakes

#### Please remember all rules to override `equals()`
#### Use prime numbers for your `hashCode()` implementation
Prime numbers are chosen to help optimize the data storage in memory.
#### Don’t forget about access modifiers
You should never want to expose the object fields directly. They should be accessed through special methods (getters and setters).
#### Don't use class Objects
You should first learn how to override `equals()` and `hashCode()` by yourself.
#### Don’t use wildcards
Use only parameterized types in your solution.
