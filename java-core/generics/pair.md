### Common Mistakes

#### Remember All Rules for Overriding `equals()`
Ensure you adhere to all the guidelines and rules when overriding the `equals()` method.

#### Utilize Prime Numbers in Your `hashCode()` Implementation
Prime numbers are chosen to help optimize data storage in memory.

#### Don't Neglect Access Modifiers
You should never expose object fields directly. They should be accessed through special methods (getters and setters).

#### Avoid Using Class Objects
Initially, learn how to override `equals()` and `hashCode()` on your own without relying on the Objects class.

#### Avoid Using Wildcards
Employ only parameterized types in your solution, avoiding the use of wildcards.
