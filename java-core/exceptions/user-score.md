### Common mistakes

#### Don’t use commented code.
It's important to develop good practices from the vey beginning and fix bad ones. Pushing commented code belongs to the las one.
So whenever you create PR double check again for not having commented code there. 
The main problem is commented code adds confusion with no real benefit, because in any case while using repository 
with commented code in it you will waste some time analyzing its purpose and the reason it was added in the first place. 

#### Don’t complicate if-else construction. [Detailed explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-UmyrbGjwE&list=PL7FuXFaDeEX1smwnp-9ri8DBpgdo7Msu2)

### Be attentive about the class you extend to declare your exception
Should it extend `RuntimeException` or `Exception` and think why. (double check task description)

#### Don’t create unneeded variables.
Try to keep your code simple. That is one of the core principle in programming. If you create a variable without any 
particular reason in mind - think twice if it is required and whether we can complete task without it and we won't 
decrease code readability.

#### Remember about informative name of the variables.
