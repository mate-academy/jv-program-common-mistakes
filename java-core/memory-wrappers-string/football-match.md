### Common Mistakes

#### Avoid Commented Code
It's crucial to develop good practices from the outset and rectify bad ones. Pushing commented code falls into the latter category. Therefore, whenever you create a PR, double-check for the absence of commented code. The main issue with commented code is that it adds confusion without any real benefit. While using a repository with commented code, you will waste time analyzing its purpose and the reason why it was added.

#### Prefer Ternary Operator Over If-Else
The ternary operator is a condensed form of the `if-else` statement that also returns a value. It often helps make your code look cleaner.

#### Avoid Redundant Variables
Redundant variables are somewhat similar to commented code. They create confusion, make your code less clean, and are more difficult to read. Additionally, they occupy stack memory.

#### Maintain Whitespace Between Operators
According to convention, all binary operators (those operators that work with two operands) should be separated from their operands by spaces.
