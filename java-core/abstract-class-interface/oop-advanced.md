### Common mistakes

#### Don't use abstract classes to set behaviour for classes
Abstract classes and interfaces have different use cases. Try to figure out when to use 
both in this task by yourself. If you're blocked [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/479168) may give you a hint.

#### Use only eng in messages/code:
Try not to use ukr/ru messages in `toString()` or `System.out.println()` statements.
We want to make our code universal and consistent.
