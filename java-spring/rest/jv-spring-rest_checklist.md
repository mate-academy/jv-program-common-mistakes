# Spring REST

* Return `id` of entity in all response DTOs.
* Remember about [REST resource-naming convention](https://restfulapi.net/resource-naming/).
* In your mappers prefer setters over big constructors while converting entity to dto and vice versa.
* Use Stream API while working with lists in your mappers.
